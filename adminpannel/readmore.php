                        We believe that every child is a unique individual with their own characteristics and temperament. Children need a loving and close relationship with people taking care of them to create a new generation with a responsible attitude to society and the future of Nepal. Young children learn most effectively through hands -on experience. It is our challenges as well as opportunitiy to establish high academic standards for the all-round development of the children with linguistic, numeric, spiritual, emotional and social skills.

                        A step in right direction can lead to the journey of miles; education in the context of Nepal is hope for its development. The school has maintained a truly modern-day marvel, which is one of the best and high-standard quality education catering centers at Buddha Nagar at the heart of Baneshwor, Kathmandu, Nepal. Children can build up confidence to tackle any problem they come across in their future professional careers.

                        Let us give them an opportunity to develop their knowledge and skills at their own pace with their needs and stages of development. Let us motivate and encourage them to develop their learning through purposeful play way methods and supportive activities to assist them for their physical, social, intellectual and emotional development. The principle of the school is based on the four themes of the Early Year Foundation Stage (EYFS). Every child is born a competent learner, who can be resistant, capable, confident and self - assured. They learn to be strong and independent from a base of loving and secured relationships with parents, friends and teachers. The environment plays a vital role to support and extend childrenâ€™s development and learning. Children develop and can learn at different rates in all areas of learning and development, which are equally important and inter- connected.
